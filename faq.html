    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>Can I rotate the dominos?</h2>
    <div>You can't rotate the dominos. This game is hard! </div>
    <h2>How many solutions are there per level?</h2>
    <div>1</div>
    <h2>Why only the 01 and 02 dominos?</h2>
    <div>Higher domino #s make the levels too large, like 23 12 25 21 11 (ew)</div>
    <div>Lower domino #s (01 01) make the levels look samey, like 5 5 5 5 </div>
    <div>01/02 was "just right" and has certain properties (if you play a lot you prolly know what I mean)</div>
    <h2>What does "wizardry", or the wizard emoji mean?</h2>
    <div>It means you solved it without making any mistakes, which is pretty crazy considering originally I didn't even think the game was possible to solve period, hahaha. </div>
    <h2>How are the dailies chosen?</h2>
    <div>As of the last update, they are completely random. Before they were pretty much random as well (minus the first 5 days which were hand picked), however they were ordered by difficulty. Now they are just 100% random. </div>
    <div>The earlier levels have more blocks than the later ones so they are typically a little easier, but honestly they can all be dangerous.</div>
    <h2>Can I contact you for feedback or just to chat?</h2>
    <div>No. JK of course you can, my email is joeycaero@gmail.com I can be slow to respond but I'll try</div>
